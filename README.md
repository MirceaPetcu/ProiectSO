The project involves synchronizing the local file system with a Dropbox account. Once a file/directory from the local file system is synchronized with the Dropbox account, all valid actions in the dbxcli environment will also be performed on the local system. Additionally, all commands not found in Dropbox but usable in the Linux environment will be executed when called. The main advantage of the project is that a directory can be uploaded to Dropbox along with all its first-level content. Files/directories not synchronized with Dropbox can still be operated on using Linux commands on the local system.

To run this project, you will need to create a Dropbox account (https://www.dropbox.com/home) and install the dbxcli file specific to your personal computing system from the source: https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli/releases.

A token will be generated to connect the local file system with the Dropbox environment.
